# DATA 4319 Projects

For this class, we are tasked to design 10 machine learning projects. The projects are individuals and only review by the course instructor at the end of course for a final evaluation.

The machine learning algorithms programmed from scratch are Logistic regression, MLP, Pocket algorithm, Perceptron algorithm, Linear regression, and KNN.
The other algorithms were imported from python TensorFlow and scikit-learn libraries.

Other skills displayed are data pre-processing, data cleaning, etc.
